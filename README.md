## About

GibsoniaCraft is a plugin created for a dorm Minecraft server. GibsoniaCraft is partially a remake from the ground up of BradzCraft (a plugin made for a previous dorm server) (Credit: [BradzTech](https://github.com/bradztech)). There are three goals behind GibsoniaCraft:
- To have a custom plugin with desired features for for an otherwise lightweight server
- To begin learning Java
- To begin learning Bukkit API (and subsequent derivatives (-> Spigot -> Paper))
